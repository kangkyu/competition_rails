# Competition app: Ruby on Rails version 7.0

- Many users submit scores at the same time
- Save all to the database
- user, like, contestant
- Screen should show "my votes" for the user. That would be a list of contestants with their "vote" the user selected. The user should be able to select and update the "vote" of each contestant
- the "total votes" screen is on the separate page for current running result of total scores from all users of all contestant. It can be accessed only by admin.
- I want it to be a Rails app with hotwire
- I might try google cloud platform this time?
